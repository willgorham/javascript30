# 04 - Array Cardio Day 1

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/04%20-%20Array%20Cardio%20Day%201/index.html)

This exercise was a series of array method questions, not a typical project. The result from each question is output in the console.


### What did this project involve?

- Array methods (`filter`, `map`, `reduce`, `sort`)

### What did I learn?

Mostly review here, but...
- `console.table` is useful!
- `Array.from` (ES6) can be used to convert array-like objects to arrays.

### Additional things:

No additional changes for this task.
