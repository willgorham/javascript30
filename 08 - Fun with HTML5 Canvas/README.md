# 08 - Fun with HTML5 Canvas

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/08%20-%20Fun%20with%20HTML5%20Canvas/index.html)

This was a fun exercise and a good re-intro to the canvas API. The challenge was to build out a simple drawing interface, but there were some interesting componenets that required a bit more depth. I mostly followed along with the video for this one because I wasn't familiar with canvas, but completed some of the line animations and changes individually.

### What did this project involve?

- HTML5 Canvas
- Mouse event handling
- Setting flags and toggling direction of iteration

### What did I learn?

- A bunch about interacting with a canvas! How to set context styles, drawing paths, and managing mouse interactions. Canvases are incredibly versatile, I just haven't used them in daily work. It's always good to be reminded of features and functionality that you might want to use in the future.
- ES6 array destructring and assignment (e.g. `[a, b] = 'aVal', 'bVal'; console.log(a) // 'aVal'`).
- Brushed up on how HSL works: hue ~= color, saturation = grayscale to full-color, lightness = white to black.

### Additional things:

No additional changes for this task.
