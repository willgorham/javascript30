# 06 - Type Ahead

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/06%20-%20Type%20Ahead/index.html)

Finally things get a little more complicated ðŸ˜„. This was a fun little 'autocomplete'-type project that relies on an external 'endpoint' for data. The goal was to fetch the data and display matching results based on the user input (with some nice CSS styling to boot).

### What did this project involve?

- `fetch`-ing data from a third-party endpoint
- Promise handling
- Processing a JSON response
- RegEx matching and replacing
- Array `.map` and `.filter`

### What did I learn?

- How to use the ES6 speard operator to push JSON data into an array.
- This was a good refresher on basic data handling: fetching, parsing, and mapping the data to HTML output.

### Additional things:

A small bit of refactoring beyond what was shown in the video to break out some funcitonality into a separate function.
