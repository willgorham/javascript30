# 28 - Video Speed Controller

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/28%20-%20Video%20Speed%20Controller/index.html)

Set up a video playback speed controller.

### What did this project involve?

- More math, and element positioning / calculations.
- Working with HTML5 video element (a tiny bit).

### What did I learn?

- Another all-review project, but working though the math problems in this one was enjoable.
- `Number.prototype.toPrecision()` returns a string of a number containing the requested significant digits, while `.toFixed()` returns a string fixed-point representation of the number with the specified number of decimal places. Cool.
