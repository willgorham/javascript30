# 22 - Follow Along Link Highlighter

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/22%20-%20Follow%20Along%20Link%20Highlighter/index.html)

A fun little hover transition for link elements, inspired by Stripe.com's homepage navigation.

### What did this project involve?

- More page positioning / offset work. I feel like with this exercise I finally nailed down the client / page / offset / rect differences.

### What did I learn?

- `window.pageYOffset` and `window.pageXOffset` are aliases for `window.scrollY` and `window.scrollX`.

### Additional things:

Wes used the transition property while I used top and left style. He said there were potentia benefits to using teh transition, but I'm not really sure what those would be...
