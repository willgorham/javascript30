# 01 - JavaScript Drum Kit

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit/index.html)

A pretty cool little drum kit that was fun and easy to make. I stopped the video at the beginning and worked through the problem myself before going back and seeing how Wes completed it. I think I'll continue do work through the videos this way to help solidify my JS skills. It was a fun challenge to clear away all the cruft of compliers, build tools, and libraries and just focus on vanilla JS.

### What did this project involve?

- Audio file playback
- Event handling
- Class toggling

### What did I learn?

- How to reset an audio file to the begging of the track (allows playback to start at the beginning if 'play' is pressed when already playing).
- The `transitionend` event exists. Cool ðŸ˜Ž.

### Additional things:

The project only required handling of keyboard events/playing, but it made sense to me to be able to play the drum kit with your mouse as well. I added a click event handler and refactored/abstracted the existing code to be able to handle both mouse and keyboard playing.
