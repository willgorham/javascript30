# 21 - Geolocation

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/21%20-%20Geolocation/index.html)

This has become a series of simple projects that touch on various browser APIs (and less about JavaScript itself). That's ok - and I'm definitely learning quite a bit about native APIs! - but I'd love to get back to actual coding problems instead of simple API method call and print data to an HTML element.

### What did this project involve?

- Using the `navigator.geolocation` API

### What did I learn?

- XCode Safari simulator exists! You can also open up dev tools in Safari simulator to debug your application.
