# 11 - Custom Video Player

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/11%20-%20Custom%20Video%20Player/index.html)

Creating an HTML5 video player with custom controls is a lot easier than I expected.

### What did this project involve?

- Lots of event listening, and updating video properties based on those events

### What did I learn?

- A good amount about the `<video>` element and its properties, e.g. `.pause()` `.play()`, `.currentTime` and `.duration`

### Additional things:

I handled the srubbing function a little differently than the example, by accounting for the mouse leaving the progress bar when dragging.
