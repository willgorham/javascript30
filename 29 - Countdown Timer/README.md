# 29 - Countdown Timer

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/29%20-%20Countdown%20Timer/index.html)

A countdown timer that contains various preset buttons and a custom input.

### What did this project involve?

- Time math.
- Working with Date objects.
- Repeating actions / intervals.
- Form submit handling.

### What did I learn?

- Any element that has a `name` attribute can be directly seleted by calling `document.nameAttributeValue`. Pretty cool! Any nested elements can be selected in a similar way, e.g. `document.nameAttributValue.nestedElementNameAttributValue`.

### Additional things:

I added hour handling (on top of minute/second handling) which added to the calculations a little bit, but makes the whole thing much more usable in my opinion :).
