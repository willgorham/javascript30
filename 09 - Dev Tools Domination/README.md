# 09 - Dev Tools Domination

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/09%20-%20Dev%20Tools%20Domination/index.html)

Well, this was a cool DevTools whirlwind.

### What did this project involve?

- A whole bunch of `console.something` methods that could be super useful (or not, in some cases ðŸ˜„) for better console output.

### What did I learn?

- All kinds of cool tricks. Highlights are:
- `console.group` / `console.groupCollapsed` are great for outputting groupons of data instead of doing things line-by-line.
- `console.dir` for displaying details object properties.
- `console.table` is still great.

### Additional things:

No additional changes for this task.
