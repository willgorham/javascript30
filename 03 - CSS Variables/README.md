# 03 - CSS Variables

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/03%20-%20CSS%20Variables/index.html)

This task required linking up inputs to CSS variable declarations in order to update CSS properties live when the inputs are updated. A very simple task, but I found some of the small details to be good reminders (see below!).


### What did this project involve?

- CSS variables
- Setting CSS properties via JS on input changes

### What did I learn?

- The `root` element is accesset by `document.documentElement`.
- `HTMLelemenet.dataset` can be used to access all `data-` attributes of an element.
- A `NodeList` object has a `forEach` method so you don't need to convert to and array before iterating though the list.

### Additional things:

No additional changes for this task.
