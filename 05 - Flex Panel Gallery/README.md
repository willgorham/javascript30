# 05 - Flex Panel Gallery

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/05%20-%20Flex%20Panel%20Gallery/index.html)

Not much new here in terms of JS (not much JS at all!), just some class toggling and simple event handling. Most of this task was following along with the video to see what was required for the end result. Flexbox implementation was pretty simple and the transitions were already included in the starter file.

### What did this project involve?

- Flexbox positioning (`flex-grow`, `justify-content`, `align-items`)
- CSS transforms (`translateY`)
- HTMLelement classList toggling
- Event handling on `click` and `transitionend`

### What did I learn?

- Using `.includes` in an if statement to look for a partial string.
- This one has some nice looking flex transitions and animations that were incredibly easy to implement. Nice seeing things like this done cleanly!

### Additional things:

No additional changes for this task.
