# 27 - Click and Drag

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/27%20-%20Click%20and%20Drag/index.html)

Build a click-and-drag scrolling panel. Nice.

### What did this project involve?

- More practice finding positional coordinates of elements and events, and combining them to create interactions.

### What did I learn?

- Nothing particularly new here, just concepts used in a different manner. Wes again uses offsetLeft and I still feel like using getBoundingCLientRect is more appropriate, but again I'm not sure if there's a specific correct way to do these things. Adding/subtracting positions is relative anyway, so the specific reference point (whether that's the window, page, client, nearest positioned parent, etc) is irrelevant as long as you're using the same reference for all calculations.
