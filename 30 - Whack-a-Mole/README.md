# 30 - Whack-a-Mole

### [View demo](https://willgorham.github.io/javascript30/30%20-%20Whack-a-Mole/index.html)

The final day! This task was to create a Whack-a-Mole game in the browser.

### What did this project involve?

- A nice little combination of things that have been covered over the course of these lessons.

### What did I learn?

- `Event.isTrusted` will be true if the event was generated by a user action, and false if generated by a script or dispatchEvent. I had no idea about this, but I knew someone who was trying to programatically generate clicks on ad placements - I'm sure the advertisers were aware of `isTrusted` :). Always fun to learn about handy properties that you didn't know existed before!
